# FFPR-ATBFix
A BepInEx dll that attempts to fix the jittering of the ATB bar within the FINAL FANTASY PIXEL REMASTERS.

# Installation:
1. Install an IL2CPP Bleeding-Edge build of BepInEx 6, which can be found [here](https://builds.bepis.io/projects/bepinex_be) or used from a prior Memoria installation
2. Drop the BepInEx folder from the mod into the game's main directory and merge folders if prompted
